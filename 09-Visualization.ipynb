    "The mathematician Richard Hamming once said, “The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers,” and the best way to develop insight is often to visualize data. Visualization deserves an entire lecture of its own, but we can explore a few features of Python’s `matplotlib` library here. While there is no official plotting library, `matplotlib` is the de facto standard.\n",
