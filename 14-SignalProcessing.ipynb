If we plot the Fourier transform itself by typing `plt.plot(fourier)`, it will yield a funky plot. That’s because the complex numbers represent both magnitude and phase at once, but we are _only interested in amplitude or power_ at this point, which is why we plotted only the absolute values above. Also, if you type `plt.plot(abs(fourier))`, you will get a plot of all the magnitudes, but note that it is mirror-symmetric in the middle—it repeats after half the sampling rate."
