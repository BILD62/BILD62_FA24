    "3. Write a function `create_dictionary` that takes two input lists `lst_1` and `lst_2`. Inside the function, join the two lists to form a dictionary `joined_dictionary` where the first element in `lst_1` is the first key in `joined_dictionary` and the the first element in `lst_2` is the first value in joined_dictionary and so on and so forth. Then return `joined_dictionary` as the output."
