    "## Part I. About Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to combine executable code, code outputs, and text into one connected file. They run in a web browser, but don't require the internet (unless you're running it on the DataHub).\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>'kernel'</b> is the thing that executes your code. It is what connects the notebook (as you see it) with the part of your computer, or the DataHub computers, that runs code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks have two types of cells, a <b>Markdown</b> (like this one) and <b>Code</b>. In assignments and in viewing lectures, you don't need to run the Markdown cells, just read through them. However, when we get to a code cell, you need to tell Jupyter to run the lines of code that it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Menu Options & Shortcuts\n",
    "To get a quick tour of the Jupyter user-interface, click on the 'Help' menu, then click 'Jupyter Reference'. There are also a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. Click on the 'Help' menu, and then 'Keyboard Shortcuts' to see a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">When you're in <b>Command mode</b>, cells are outlined in blue</span>. <span style=\"color:green\">When you're in <b>Edit mode</b>, blocks are outlined in green</span>.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Using Markdown\n",
    "Markdown is useful because it can be formatted using simple symbols.\n",
    "* You can create bulleted lists using asterisks.\n",
    "* Similarly, you can create numbered lists using numbers.\n",
    "* You can **bold** with two asterisks or underscores on either side (`**bold**`) or *italicize* with one asterisk or underscore (`*italicize*`)\n",
    "* Pound signs (#) create headers. More pound signs means a smaller header.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task**: Edit the markdown cell below with a quick biography of yourself. You should have your name as a big header, a short quippy subtitle for yourself as a smaller header, and a three bullet points that use both **bold** and *italic*.</div>"
